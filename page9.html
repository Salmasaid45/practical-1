    <h1>SECURITY AND ACCESSIBILITY BALANCE</h1>
    <P>When considering information security, it is important to realize that it is impossible to obtain perfect security. Security is not an absolute; it is a process not a goal. 
        Security should be considered a balance between protection and availability. 
        To achieve balance the level of security must allows reasonable access, yet protect against threats
        </P>
        <ol>
            <li>There must always be a delicate balance between security and accessibility. 
                The more accessible a network is, the less secure it is. 
                When it comes to a computer network, how much security is enough? 
                </li>
            <p>There are several factors to consider:</p>
                  <li>  The type of business in which the company engages</li>
                   <li>The type of data stored on the network</li>
                   <li>The management philosophy of the organization </li>
