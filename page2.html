    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK SECURITY</h1>
    <P> Many of the topics you study can be implemented at the lab, for example new programming, system analysis and design projects, BUT Security is a little different…
        The best security specialists combine their: practical knowledge of computers and networks with theories about security, technology, and human nature (behaviour). 
        These concepts, some borrowed from other fields like military defense, often take years of experience.
        Note that no two systems are identical in solving the security problems, and no books to consult on how to solve security problems, so you have to depend on principle –based analysis and decision making.
