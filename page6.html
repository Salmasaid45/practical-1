    <h1>CHARACTERISTICS OF INFORMATION SECURITY</h1>
    <ol>
        <P>The value of information comes from the characteristics it possesses. 
        </P> 
        <li>Availability - enables users who need to access information to do so without interference or obstruction and in the required format. 
            The information is said to be available to an authorized user when and where needed and in the correct format.  
            </li> 
        <li>Accuracy- free from mistake or error and having the value that the end-user expects. 
            If information contains a value different from the userâ€™s expectations due to the intentional or unintentional modification of its content, it is no longer accurate.
            </li>
        <li>Authenticity - the quality or state of being genuine or original, rather than a reproduction or fabrication.  
            Information is authentic when has the information that was originally created, placed, stored, or transferred.  
            </li>
        <li>Confidentiality - the quality or state of preventing disclosure or exposure to unauthorized individuals or systems. </li> 
           <li>Integrity - the quality or state of being whole, complete, and uncorrupted.
            The integrity of information is threatened when the information is exposed to corruption, damage, destruction, or other disruption of its authentic state. </li>
           <li> Utility - the quality or state of having value for some purpose or end user.
            Information has value when it serves a particular purpose.  This means that if information is available, but not in a format meaningful to the end-user, it is not useful.</li>
           <li> Possession - the quality or state of having ownership or control of some object or item.  
            Information is said to be in possession if one obtains it, independent of format or other characteristic. While a breach of confidentiality always results in a breach of possession, a breach of possession does not always result in a breach of confidentiality.</li>
