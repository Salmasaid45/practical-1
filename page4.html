    <h1>security</h1>
    <p>Security is the quality or state of being secure--to be free from danger.  
        It means to be protected from adversaries--from those who would do harm, intentionally or unintentionally.
        A successful organization should have the following multiple layers of security in place for the protection of its operations: 
        Physical security -  to protect the physical items, objects, or areas of an organization from unauthorized access and misuse.
        Personal security – to protect the individual or group of individuals who are authorized to access the organization and its operations.
        Operations security – to protect the details of a particular operation or series of activities.
        Communications security – to protect an organization’s communications media, technology, and content.
        Network security – to protect networking components, connections, and contents.
