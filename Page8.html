    <h1>SECURING THE COMPONENTS</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>When considering the security of information systems components, it is important to understand the concept of the computer as the subject of an attack as opposed to the computer as the object of an attack.  
        </li>
        <li>When a computer is the subject of an attack, it is used as an active tool to conduct the attack. When a computer is the object of an attack, it is the entity being attacked.
